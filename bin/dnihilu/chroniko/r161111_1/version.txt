- Fixed the issue with the runoff code I had before
- Beat markers are now properly placed "below" notes in the Z-order.
I had been trying to keep all the scrolling items in the same vector,
but that's now obviously a bad idea, so I'm storing each visual element
separately.
- Notes are now deleted if "played" at the right time.
Now I just need to make some animations and it'll feel fun to play!
Oh, and also expand the hitbox a tiny bit more and figure out video delay.
I might change the fret glow thing, it was a cool idea but in practice
it's a little weird.
